HOW TO USE THE SAMPLES:

Two gray polygons will appear onscreen.
Each polygon is surrounded by a bounding rectangle.

The third (red) polygon appears when there is a collision, and is the suggested resolution based on the minimum translation vector.

Background Colors:
White			=> No Collision.
Light Yellow	=> Bounds Collide, objects do not.
Green			=> Bounds and Objects collide.

[Z] to switch bounding mode to bounding boxes.
[X] to switch bounding mode to bounding squares.

[C] to switch polygon type of first object.
[V] to switch polygon type of second object.

Left Click to position first object.
Right Click to position second object.

[QW] to rotate first object.
[ER] to scale first object.

[AS] to rotate second object.
[DF] to scale second object.
